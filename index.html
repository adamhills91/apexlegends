      <h2>A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES</h2>
      <p>The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between the IMC and the militia founded to fight them, the
        region of space known as the Frontier can finally see peace.</p>
      <p>But liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled
        to nothing. With no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice but to leave their homes. The
        brave relocated to the Outlands.</p>
      <p>A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the Frontier, the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with
        resources and opportunity. But life is cheap here, and danger lurks around every corner. Its pioneers,
        explorers, and outlaws used to spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle – now, they settle their
        differences in the Apex Games, a bloodsport where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for money,
        fame, and glory.</p>

          <h2>Professional Soldier</h2>
          <p>Born into a military family where she, her parents, and her four older brothers all served in the IMC
            Armed
            Forces, Bangalore has been an exceptional soldier since she was young. She was top of her class at the IMC
            Military Academy and the only cadet who could take apart a Peacekeeper, equip it with a Precision Choke
            hop-up, and put it back together in under twenty seconds – blindfolded.</p>
          <p>In the final months of the war, Anita and her brother Jackson were ordered to retrieve a mercenary fleet
            from
            the Outlands to aid in the IMC’s fight against the Militia. However, their unit lost contact with IMC HQ
            and
            were ambushed on arrival. The squad scattered, but Jackson stayed behind to give his sister time to
            escape.
            Alone and with no way home, Anita put her training, extensive weapon knowledge, and competitive spirit to
            work
            by joining the Apex Games. Now, she fights to raise money for passage back to the IMC home base, where she
            hopes to reunite with what remains of her family.</p>

          <h2>Technological Tracker</h2>
          <p>Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen –
            and that’s about all anyone knows. Their identity is a mystery wrapped in layers of rumors: they are
            fabulously wealthy, a bloodthirsty murderer, a Goliath whisperer, a former slave, half bat, and a dozen
            other things depending on who’s doing the whispering.</p>
          <p>All anyone truly knows is that Bloodhound is a force to be reckoned with in the Apex Games. Bloodhound’s
            unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team they join, helping them root out hidden opponents and
            tracking the enemy’s movements. Calling on Earth’s Old Norse Gods to guide them, Bloodhound believes that
            destiny is a path that has already been laid out, eventually carrying all to their death. But with that
            knowledge comes strength, because until that day comes, Bloodhound knows they can’t be stopped.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Trapper</h2>
          <p>Before there was Caustic, a scientist named Alexander Nox worked at Humbert Labs, the Frontier’s leading
            manufacturer of pesticide gases. With a glut of pesticides needed to protect the growing Frontier colonies’
            crops, Humbert Labs was constantly on the hunt for better and stronger formulas. Nox was one of their
            brightest scientists and worked day and night developing new gases. But to make sure they worked, he needed
            to test them on more than just inert tissue: he needed something living.</p>
          <p>As he toiled in secret, Nox began to see the beauty in his creations and their ability to destroy anything
            they touched. But the head of Humbert Labs soon discovered his gruesome experiments, and their confrontation
            ended with the lab in flames and its chief dead. Today, Nox is missing and presumed deceased. Caustic,
            meanwhile, now finds new test subjects in the Apex Games, where he puts his gaseous creations to work and
            observes their effects with great interest.</p>

          <h2>Surveillance Expert</h2>
          <p>Crypto specializes in secrets; he knows how to uncover them, and how to keep them. A brilliant hacker and
            encryption expert, he uses aerial drones to spy on his opponents in the Apex Arena without being seen. It’s
            been noted that his drones have a similar design to those created by wanted murderer Tae Joon Park.</p>
          <p>Orphans raised on the streets of Suotamo, Tae Joon and his foster sister Mila Alexander escaped a life of
            squalor by becoming computer engineers, designing drones that transmit the Apex Games throughout the
            Outlands. But one day, Tae Joon disappeared with an important company secret, and his sister vanished under
            mysterious and violent circumstances. However, Crypto claims to have had no contact with Tae Joon, and the
            case remains unsolved.</p>
          <p>Crypto’s motives for joining the Apex Games are almost as mysterious as the man himself. In recent
            interviews, he claims he is seeking justice – but for what, exactly, remains unknown.</p>

          <h2>Shielded Fortress</h2>
          <p>Gibraltar is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two SARAS (Search and Rescue Association of
            Solace) volunteers, he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common
            in the Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and his
            boyfriend stole his father’s motorcycle, took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His
            parents saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Gibraltar has never forgotten that sacrifice
            and has devoted his life to helping those in need.</p>
          <p>The Apex Games didn’t change that, but they changed what it meant. Many of Gibraltar’s friends and
            colleagues have competed in the Games for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, and some never came
            home. Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, his skills as a rescuer and his rebellious
            nature worked together. He’s now become an icon in the Apex Games, putting himself in the line of fire to
            protect his squad and send his opponents running for cover.</p>

          <h2>Combat Medic</h2>
          <p>Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. Once the child of wealthy
            war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the
            Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her
            life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to fund the Frontier Corps with her winnings.</p>
          <p>Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her
            victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or so
            she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the
            world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.</p>

          <h2>Holographic Trickster</h2>
          <p>Mirage is the kind of guy who likes to stand out. The youngest of four brothers, he perfected the art of
            fooling around to get attention. The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology: introduced to
            the illusion-creating tech by his engineer mother, he poured over the mechanisms and learned all he could
            about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and his mother continued to
            develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer.</p>
          <p>While working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage heard amazing stories from his patrons about the
            Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. As good as both of those sounded, he knew he
            couldn’t risk leaving his mother childless – until she gave him a set of customized holo devices and told
            him to follow his dream. Mirage is now the life of the Apex Games, outwitting opponents and charming
            audiences across the Outlands.</p>

          <h2>The Adrenaline Junkie</h2>
          <p>One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Heir to the preoccupied CEOs of Silva
            Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts
            and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. So, this day, he decided to set the course record
            for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade.</p>
          <p>As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his
            daredevil days were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help: Ajay Che,
            who he guilted into forging an order to replace his legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs
            at a moment’s notice, Octavio decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate adrenaline rush, the
            Apex Games, was calling. Now, he’s going to become an Apex Champion doing the most incredible, death-defying
            moves anyone’s ever seen. Maybe in the arena, he won’t be so bored.</p>

          <h2>Forward Scout</h2>
          <p>Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity)
            modified to specialize in location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned
            laboratory with no idea who created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity,
            Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his creator.</p>
          <p>Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but
            hasn’t come any closer to finding his creator. Still, he’s never given up hope, and has joined the Apex
            Games to gain a following--and hopefully draw the attention of his maker. In the meantime, he remains
            enthusiastic and helpful, always ready to make new friends (then shoot them).</p>

          <h2>Synthetic Nightmare</h2>
          <p>Revenant used to be human. He used to be the greatest hitman the Mercenary Syndicate ever had. He used to
            look in the mirror and see his human face looking back. But time changes everything, and when his
            programming finally failed, he saw what he had become at the hands of the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond
            Robotics: a walking nightmare of steel and vestigial flesh. His masters resurrected him as a simulacrum,
            snatching him from death’s embrace again and again and programming him to forget.</p>
          <p>He swore he would hunt down every last person who did this to him, but more than two centuries have passed,
            and they're all gone… or so he thought. The return of Hammond Robotics to the Outlands has renewed his
            thirst for vengeance, and he won’t stop until anybody connected to Hammond is dead. Of course, he doesn’t
            mind eviscerating a few of the Legends along the way. He used to need a reason to kill… but he’s not that
            man anymore.</p>

          <h2>Static Defender</h2>
          <p>Natalie “Wattson” Paquette is a familiar face in the Apex Games, though for a different reason than most.
            Daughter of the Games’ lead electrical engineer, she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and
            discovered her calling at a young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and
            hyper-focused the next, electricity grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense in a way the
            rest of the world didn’t.</p>
          <p>She devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such a skilled engineer that she
            was commissioned to build the Apex Games’ Modified Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her father died the day
            it was revealed, leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors invited her to return to
            the arena with them, assuring her she would always have a home. She now fights alongside her friends in the
            arena she helped build, destroying incoming missiles, recharging shields, creating fences, and using her
            pylon to silence fights that get too loud. Nobody knows the arena better than Wattson – anyone who
            underestimates her is in for a shock.</p>

          <h2>Interdimensional Skirmisher</h2>
          <p>Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute swift and deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by
            opening
            rifts in the fabric of reality — but she has no idea how she got that way. Years ago, she woke up in an
            IMC
            Detention Facility for the Mentally Ill with no memory of her life before. She also began hearing a
            distant
            voice whispering in her mind that would keep her awake for days on end. Despite nearly driving her insane,
            once she started to listen and trust it, the voice helped her harness her newfound power of void
            manipulation and escape the facility.</p>
          <p>Determined to uncover her true identity, Wraith began a quest to find out more about the experiments.
            Many
            of the old research facilities, however, are buried beneath heavily guarded arenas used for the Apex
            Games.
            Now Wraith has joined the competition, and with every match she gets closer to the truth.</p>
